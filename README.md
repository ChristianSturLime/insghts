# 14.11.2022 Log Tracking: Grafana: What is Grafana?
- a visualization tool for logs, metrics with a time-series nature
# 14.111.2022 MLFlow: What is MLFlow?
- MLFlow is a tool to track experiment metrics, models and serve them
- Ideal for Hyperparameter-tuning?
# 14.11.2022 Models: Decision Trees: How do decision trees learn?
1. Determine metric with highest entropy
2. Find a line to separate based on that feature into classes
3. Inside new split repeat 1-2. until all features gone through

# 14.11.2022 Model Serving: Nvidia Triton: What is Nvidia Triton?
- Nvidida Triton is a middlepiece focusing on fast inference/prediction model serving and the hardware balancing involved in it
# 14.11.2022 Pipeline Orchestration: Kedro: What is Kedro?
- A modular setup for building, managing, containerizing data science workflows
- includes preprocessing, data versioning, paralellization, requirements handling, visualizations

# 03.11.2022 Agile: What is the Spotify Framework?
- based on Scrum with less formal methods
- central are autonomous groups (squad) that do everything from early development to maintainance
- management focuses on what and why to focus on and engineers try to find the solutions
- details mostly left for the engineers; bigger stuff by management
- low degree of handovers
- chapters are job-title related people
- guilds are cross-group interest structures
![Alignment and Autonomy](https://miro.medium.com/max/720/1*B-0hwMt7gJKo7643fAYyNg.png)
- small frequent releasing with decoupled components; a lot of automated tests, CI/CD
- regular releases (1-3 weeks) including unfinished features that are no activated => see issues arise without exposure


# 02.11.2022 Machine Learning Models: Pruning: What is model pruning and why do it?
- On average model size can be reduced (= Pruning) by 3 to 10 times with less than 10 percent loss in performance
# 02.11.2022 Reading: What is a white paper?
- a simplified paper that focuses on an audience with very little background knowledge
- a how-to/guide/overview
